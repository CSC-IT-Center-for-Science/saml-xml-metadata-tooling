# XmlDiffer #

XmlDiffer is an Java project to compare two SAML XML metadata files with each other for changes. Currently it is specifically amed to serve Haka federation, but may be of use also for other SAML based federations with minor modifications.

The project is on development status and should not be considered as production ready.

### Set up ###

Project is supposed to be run in embedded Jetty server. The code will be compiled to a single jar package. Running the JettyExperiment class main method will launch the diff service within standalone Jetty server. Practically, a proxy is needed in front of the server. Use Apache Ã…roxyPass or similar.

The package may also be driven from the command line with arguments.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* what is a SAML federation
* what is Haka
